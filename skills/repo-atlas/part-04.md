## Codemap Content

Fixers are responsible for writing `codemap.md` files during this workflow. Use precise technical terminology to document the implementation:

- **Responsibility** - Define the specific role of this directory using standard software engineering terms (e.g., "Service Layer", "Data Access Object", "Middleware").
- **Design Patterns** - Identify and name specific patterns used (e.g., "Observer", "Singleton", "Factory", "Strategy"). Detail the abstractions and interfaces.
- **Data & Control Flow** - Explicitly trace how data enters and leaves the module. Mention specific function call sequences and state transitions.
- **Integration Points** - List dependencies and consumer modules. Use technical names for hooks, events, or API endpoints.

Example codemap:

```markdown
# src/agents/

## Responsibility
Defines agent personalities and manages their configuration lifecycle.

## Design
Each agent is a prompt + permission set. Config system uses:
- Default prompts (orchestrator.ts, explorer.ts, etc.)
- User overrides from ~/.config/opencode/blacktower.json
- Permission wildcards for skill/MCP access control

## Flow
1. Plugin loads → calls getAgentConfigs()
2. Reads user config preset
3. Merges defaults with overrides
4. Applies permission rules (wildcard expansion)
5. Returns agent configs to OpenCode

## Integration
- Consumed by: Main plugin (src/index.ts)
- Depends on: Config loader, skills registry
```

Example **Root Codemap (Atlas)**:

```markdown
# Repository Atlas: blacktower

## Project Responsibility
A high-performance, low-latency agent orchestration plugin for OpenCode, focusing on specialized sub-agent delegation and multiplexer-assisted child sessions.

## System Entry Points
- `src/index.ts`: Plugin initialization and OpenCode integration.
- `package.json`: Dependency manifest and build scripts.
- `blacktower.json`: User configuration schema.

## Directory Map (Aggregated)
| Directory | Responsibility Summary | Detailed Map |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------|
| `src/agents/` | Defines agent personalities (Orchestrator, Explorer) and manages model routing. | `src/agents/codemap.md` |
| `src/config/` | Implements the configuration loading pipeline and environment variable injection. | `src/config/codemap.md` |
```
