# stride-threat-map

Create repo-grounded threat models. Use STRIDE, attack tree, requirements, and mitigation references only as needed.

## Workflow

1. Keep the main context short: read only the relevant reference file for the exact subtask.
2. Prefer existing scripts/templates/assets in this skill before writing ad hoc code.
3. Resolve repository facts and available tooling first. Ask only for missing information or authorization required for the requested action; continue independent authorized work.
