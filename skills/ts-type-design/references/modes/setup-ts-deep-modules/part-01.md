# Setup TS Deep Modules

Make every package in this repo a **deep module**: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. A package's public surface is its **entry points** (the files at the package root), and everything in its subfolders is hidden. This skill installs [dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) and the rules that make the entry points the only way in, then proves the rules bite.

For the vocabulary (deep module, interface, seam, depth), call the Skill tool with "codebase-design" and use its language throughout.
