## The shape this enforces

```
src/packages/
  <name>/
    index.ts        ← an entry point (public). Import this from outside.
    client.ts       ← another entry point. Packages may expose SEVERAL.
    lib/            ← implementation: hidden from outside, free to import each other.
    tests/          ← co-located tests + fixtures (a subfolder, so private).
```

The public surface is the package's **root files**, not one designated `index.ts`. By convention implementation lives in `lib/` and tests in `tests/`, giving every package the same two-folder shape. The rule itself is general, though: *anything* in *any* subfolder is private, so you never extend the config to add a folder.

Four rules, all `error`:

1. **Entry-point boundary**: code outside a package (app code or another package) may import only that package's entry points (its root files), never anything in its subfolders.
2. **Intra-package freedom**: a package's own files import each other freely.
3. **Tests through the entry points**: files under `<pkg>/tests/` may import any package's entry points and their own `tests/` fixtures, but never any package's subfolder internals (not even their own). Integration tests across packages are fine; deep imports are not.
4. **No cycles**: no dependency cycles.

**Entry points, not a barrel.** Because the public surface is *every* root file, a package can expose several small entry points (`index.ts`, `client.ts`, `server.ts`) instead of funnelling everything through one giant `index.ts`. Barrel files that re-export a whole subtree are discouraged; keep entry points small and hide implementation in subfolders.

Layering (which packages may depend on which) is a *different* concern and is left as a commented stub in the config for this repo to fill in.
