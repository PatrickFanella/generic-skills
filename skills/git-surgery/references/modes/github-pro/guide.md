# GitHub Pro

GitHub workflow procedure for repositories whose remote is `github.com`. Use the `gh` CLI with non-interactive flags. For Gitea or Forgejo remotes `gh` does not work: use `tea --login <login>` (or `tea api` for endpoints it lacks).

## Use When

- Inspecting PR context, changed files, CI status, or review comments.
- Creating/updating/commenting issues.
- Reviewing or commenting on PRs.
- Fixing GitHub Actions failures.
- Preparing commits or repo contribution workflow.
- Turning plans into GitHub issues/PRDs.

## Integration Stance

- **Primary:** `gh` CLI with non-interactive flags, after `gh auth status`.
- **Optional:** a GitHub MCP server or plugin when the active client has one connected; do not use both for the same action.
- **Gitea:** `tea`, not `gh`.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the remote is GitHub (`git remote get-url origin`) and check auth with `gh auth status`.
2. Inspect branch, diff, files, PR context, and CI before acting.
3. Stage or modify only intended files.
4. Use concise Conventional Commit messages when committing is explicitly requested.
5. For PR/issue actions, return URLs and summarize changes.
6. Never force-push, amend, or publish destructive actions unless explicitly requested.
