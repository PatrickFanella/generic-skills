## Severity Calibration

### Severity Criteria

| Severity     | Impact                                        | Likelihood             | Examples                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Data loss, security breach, complete failure  | Certain or very likely | SQL injection, auth bypass, data corruption  |
| **High**     | Significant functionality impact, degradation | Likely                 | Memory leak, missing validation, broken flow |
| **Medium**   | Partial impact, workaround exists             | Possible               | N+1 query, missing edge case, unclear error  |
| **Low**      | Minimal impact, cosmetic                      | Unlikely               | Style issue, minor optimization, naming      |

### Calibration Rules

- Security vulnerabilities exploitable by external users: always Critical or High
- Performance issues in hot paths: at least Medium
- Missing tests for critical paths: at least Medium
- Accessibility violations for core functionality: at least Medium
- Code style issues with no functional impact: Low
