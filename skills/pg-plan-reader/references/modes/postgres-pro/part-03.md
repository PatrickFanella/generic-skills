## Core Workflow

1. **Analyze performance** — Run `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` to identify bottlenecks
2. **Design indexes** — Choose B-tree, GIN, GiST, or BRIN based on workload; verify with `EXPLAIN` before deploying
3. **Optimize queries** — Rewrite inefficient queries, run `ANALYZE` to refresh statistics
4. **Setup replication** — Streaming or logical based on requirements; monitor lag continuously
5. **Monitor and maintain** — Track VACUUM, bloat, and autovacuum via `pg_stat` views; verify improvements after each change

### End-to-End Example: Slow Query → Fix → Verification

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify slow queries
SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Step 2: Analyze a specific slow query
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT TEXT)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 42 AND status = 'pending';
-- Look for: Seq Scan (bad on large tables), high Buffers hit, nested loops on large sets

-- Step 3: Create a targeted index
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_customer_status
  ON orders (customer_id, status)
  WHERE status = 'pending';  -- partial index reduces size

-- Step 4: Verify the index is used
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 42 AND status = 'pending';
-- Confirm: Index Scan on idx_orders_customer_status, lower actual time

-- Step 5: Update statistics if needed after bulk changes
ANALYZE orders;
```
