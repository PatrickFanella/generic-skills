## Setup Pattern

1. Start the app locally using the repo's documented dev command.
2. Discover existing local harnesses: Playwright tests, Cypress specs, Storybook, browser scripts, Electron launch scripts, or snapshot tools.
3. For a web app, connect to the local URL with the existing browser tooling.
4. For Electron/Chromium, enable a remote debugging port when supported.
5. Select the correct page by stable app markers, not by tab order alone.
6. Prefer accessibility roles, labels, and stable `data-*` selectors over coordinates.
