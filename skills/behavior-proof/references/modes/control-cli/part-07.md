## Profiling Recipes

- Startup regression: capture baseline and treatment startup timings under the same machine, env, and command.
- Slow operation: start a CPU profile, perform the operation, stop the profile, and compare top self-time functions.
- Memory leak: force GC if available, take a heap snapshot, perform the operation repeatedly, force GC again, and take another snapshot.
- Hang: capture the screen, active handles/resources, and a stack/CPU sample before interrupting.
