description: Use when restructuring or simplifying code without changing behavior, removing AI slop, or writing a refactor plan. Not for repeated mechanical edits across many files (sweep-rewriter).

# refactor

Preserve observable behavior and existing repository conventions. Select cleanup or a refactor plan; planning does not authorize implementation or filing an issue. Use sweep-rewriter for repeated structural transformations.

## Select a mode

- Remove AI-generated code slop and clean up code style. Read [the procedure](references/modes/deslop/guide.md).
- Surgical code refactoring to improve maintainability without changing behavior. Read [the procedure](references/modes/refactor/guide.md).
- Create a refactor plan of small verifiable units; file it as an issue on the repository's own forge (Gitea via `tea`, GitHub via `gh`) only when asked. Read [the procedure](references/modes/request-refactor-plan/guide.md).
- Simplifies code for clarity without changing behavior. Read [the procedure](references/modes/simplify/guide.md).

Resource paths inside a mode are relative to that mode directory. Run its scripts from that directory or use absolute script paths, passing the target repository explicitly.
