## Guardrails

- Do not rely on stale element references after navigation or structural changes.
- Avoid coordinate clicks unless a fresh screenshot was captured immediately before the click.
- Keep test data local and disposable.
- Do not store screenshots or heap snapshots from privacy-sensitive workspaces unless the user explicitly agrees.
- Do not hard-code selectors, ports, or script paths from another repository. Discover the current repo's local app markers.
- Clean up dev servers, debug sessions, and temp profiles when done.
